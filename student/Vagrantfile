	======== OpenHPC Virtual Lab Notice ========
	============================================
	
	Vagrant VM configuration complete!
	
      You now have a 3-node Virtual Cluster running within vagrant.

    This includes the following VMs:
      1. smshost: the SMS Host for OpenHPC (unless defined in setenv.c)
		--> This is the DEFAULT VM <--
	
	  2. client00: a compute node
      3. client01: a compute node
		==> THESE ARE MANUALLY IMPORTED AT THE MOMENT *** <==

    ++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
	 To access the SMS Host VM:
	  - vagrant ssh
	  - vagrant ssh default
	  - vagrant ssh <id>
	  - any SSH client to 127.0.0.1:2229 (vagrant::vagrant)
